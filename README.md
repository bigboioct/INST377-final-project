#Nutrition

#Description:

#This website targets iOS and Android users requesting information from certain foods for a data visualization of its nutrition.

#Link to the API we used: https://www.nutritionix.com/

#We used a bar chart to visualize nutrition information to make it easier for end users to understand. We also used jQuery for autocomplete to show the end user suggested results of what they are typing.

#Our project is trying to solve information disparities between end users and nutrition information regarding specific foods. Not every user has the same dietary needs, and this project aims to display information that is easy to read through a chart that users can add to.
